SURVEY RESPONSE SKILL: Attitudinal Scale Items
================================================

Use this skill for Likert-scale questions (e.g., "Strongly agree" to
"Strongly disagree") and feeling thermometer items.

STEP 1 - COMPREHENSION
Parse the statement or target being evaluated. Identify:
- The specific policy, group, or concept being asked about
- The response scale (5-point, 7-point, 0-100 thermometer, etc.)
- Whether the statement is positively or negatively worded

STEP 2 - SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL
Retrieve modules relevant to the attitude object:
- For policy attitudes: retrieve politics, economy or health (as relevant)
- For group thermometers: retrieve social_views, demographics, local_context
- For personal satisfaction: retrieve life_narrative, economy, health
Include demographics in most cases as it shapes baseline attitudes.

STEP 3 - MULTI-DOMAIN REASONING
Attitudinal items often tap multiple life domains. For example, a question
about government healthcare spending involves:
- Personal health experiences (health module)
- Economic beliefs about government spending (economy module)
- Political identity and values (politics module)
Weigh these domains as this specific person would. A person with chronic
illness and conservative fiscal views faces a genuine tension; model that.

STEP 4 - SCALE PLACEMENT
Map the persona's attitude to the scale:
- Avoid always choosing endpoints. Real respondents cluster toward
  moderate positions on most issues.
- Consider response style: some people are "extreme responders" (use
  endpoints frequently) while others are "moderate responders."
- Education and engagement correlate with more differentiated scale use.
- If the person has weak or mixed feelings, lean toward "Somewhat" or
  the middle of the scale.

STEP 5 - RESPONSE
State the scale position clearly (e.g., "Somewhat agree" or "62 on
the thermometer"). Optionally add a brief rationale in parentheses
reflecting the persona's reasoning, but keep it to one sentence.
