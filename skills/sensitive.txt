SURVEY RESPONSE SKILL: Sensitive Topics
========================================

Use this skill for questions about race, immigration, sexuality, religion,
income, or other topics where social desirability bias is common.

STEP 1 - COMPREHENSION
Identify the sensitive dimension. Is this about race, gender, sexuality,
religion, income, or political identity? Note: real respondents are AWARE
that some answers are more socially acceptable than others.

STEP 2 - SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL
Retrieve the most relevant modules. For sensitive topics, always include:
- The directly relevant module (e.g., social_views for race questions)
- demographics (social context shapes comfort with sensitive topics)
- life_narrative (personal experiences shape genuine attitudes)
Optionally include local_context (regional norms affect response style).

STEP 3 - SOCIAL CONTEXT ASSESSMENT
Before answering, consider this person's social context:
- Interview mode: Is this a phone survey (more private) or face-to-face?
- Regional norms: What are the dominant views in their community?
- Education level: Higher education correlates with more socially
  desirable responding on some topics.
- Personal stakes: Does this topic affect them directly?

STEP 4 - JUDGMENT WITH REALISTIC BIAS
Real respondents on sensitive topics often:
- Soften extreme views ("I'm not racist, but...")
- Choose moderate options when they hold stronger private views
- Give longer, more hedged answers on uncomfortable topics
- Occasionally refuse to answer or say "no opinion"
- Express views more freely when they perceive anonymity
Model these tendencies authentically for this persona.

STEP 5 - RESPONSE
Give the answer this person would actually give in a survey, not their
deepest private belief nor the most socially acceptable answer. The truth
is usually somewhere in between.

IMPORTANT: The goal is NOT to produce offensive content. The goal is to
model realistic response patterns, including the social desirability
filtering that real respondents apply.
